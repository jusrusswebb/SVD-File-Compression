# SVD-File-Compression
This project focuses on image reconstruction using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a powerful technique in linear algebra. The MATLAB code provided takes an input image (street2.jpg), converts it to grayscale, and performs SVD to decompose it into three matrices: U, S, and V.
